From local machine, use sshkeygen.sh $1 $2 $3 $4
where $1 is name of key to be created for ssh
$2 is username and $3 is ip of remote machine to connect to
$4 is optional if transferring files, [app, mq, api, db], only used when doing dev->qa, qa->prod
After script finishes, remote machine will have scripts needed to set up, migrate files/directories, and revert files
Need to run sshkeygen.sh again to make key for connection qa->dev, prod->qa

Once keys are made, migrate specific files needed for the machine.
Run setup files as sent over by sshkeygen.sh
After setup files are ran,
From machine that needs the files, run migration.sh $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8
Where:
$1 = key name for target machine (machine in previous lane, if qa, target is dev)
$2 = key name for local machine
$3 = file/directory name to transfer
$4 = user of target machine
$5 = ip of target machine
$6 = user of local machine
$7 = ip of local machine
$8 = location of file relative to /home/$3/repo
